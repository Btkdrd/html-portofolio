    <h2>Summary</h2>
    <p>During my studies, I was able to acquire skills in searching, collecting, processing, organizing,
        managing, and disseminating information through a lot of practical and theoretical assignments and
        analyses. In addition, I was a member of the student council which allowed me to develop and utilise my
        organizational skills. Concurrently with my studies, I have also worked in different fields, mainly at the
        hospitality industry.
        Nowadays, I am studying Data Analytics on Google Coursera , and this course helps me grow an analytical mindset
        and stimulation
        for collecting and processing data and turning them into data-driven decision-making for businesses, because I
        love to dig into
        business problems. Also I am doing my Master Degree at the University of Boras, Sweden at the field of Digital
        Library
        and Information Services ! Finally, I am a self-disciplined person who enjoys working in teams as well as
        individual.
        Don’t hesitate to send me a message. </p>
