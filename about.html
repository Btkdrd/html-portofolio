<h1>About Me</h1>
<p>My name is Dardi Zaimaj. I am 31 years old and I am trying hard to finish my master degree nowadays. Simultaneously, I love coding 
  and this why I started this particular course at Udemy, with Angela Yu. I would love to learn a lot about program languages and that's 
  my biggest goal. 
</p>

<p>I don't know if master degree will help me, due to the fact that libraries in general didn't like me a lot. More I want to work
  as an IT for the libraries and take care of their systems, software and front end jobs.

<p>
  Although, I would love to finish my master and made my family proud.
